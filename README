# Admission Predictor

## Overview

The Admission Predictor is a web application designed to help aspiring students evaluate their chances of securing admission to their desired colleges based on various parameters. Users can input their GRE scores, TOEFL scores, university ratings, SOP, LOR, CGPA, and research experience to receive a personalized prediction of their admission likelihood.

The application utilizes a machine learning model built with multiple linear regression, optimized through stochastic gradient descent, to analyze the relationships between user inputs and historical admission data.
